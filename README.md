- Once someone has used the start command everyone that wants to play should react with the emoji the bot puts.
- The Person who started the command (The Czar for the first round) will be added automatically, so feel free to grab a drink.
- The Bot will end sign-up after a minute or so, but you can always speed this up with the `!ready` command if everyone is in!

### **Answering Prompts:**

When the game has begun, you'll be sent a DM. Reply with your best answer! Prompts wont be read until everyone has answered, so no rush!
> `THE BOT WILL ONLY TAKE YOUR FIRST ANSWER, SO MAKE IT COUNT`

### **Reading Responses:**
